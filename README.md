# Google Analytics Tracking Code for Python

This is an ongoing Python port of php-ga. Nothing useful yet.  
There are some very basic versions of GA for python (not the mgmt./reports API, the tracking stuff) which do not satisfy complex applications.

So, hopefully this library will provide a very easy to use API for your python-based server-side anlytics needs.

## Tools used for porting

* Stripped down and modified version of [php2py][php2py] (emacs lisp script)
* [php2python.com][php2python] - very useful reference
* Sublime Text 2 regex-ing
* Good ol' hand coding (with ST2)
